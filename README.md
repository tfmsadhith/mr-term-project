# Mechanised Reasoning term project.

In this project, two results from elementary number theory are formalised in the Coq Proof Assistant (tCPA). The first is concerned with the parity of Fibonacci numbers (is the fifth fibonacci number odd or even?). The second is a formula for computing polygonal numbers from Prof Danvy's Summa Summarum.
